<p>I attended Wells College for three years, however when they were unable to successfully gain full accreditation for their business program I made the decision to transfer to the flagship university of my home state. </p>
<p>I am a business management major. My career interests include hospitality management, financial planning, and logistics.</p>
<p>While at Wells College I was a founding member of the student investment club. I worked with a small team to invest $250,000.</p>
