<h1>Interests</h1>
<h2 style="color:blue;">Outdoor</h2>
<p>I enjoy many outdoor activities. I've been skiing ever since I was old enough to strap into a harness. My home mountain is Sugarloaf, although I think Saddleback has the best snow on the east coast.</p>
<p>I also grew up hiking frequently, with the Appalachian trail less than an hour drive away I've been on many hiking and backpacking trips.</p>
<p>Growing up in Maine instilled a lifelong passion for fishing in me. While I prefer lobstering to fishing with a rod and a reel, nothing makes me happier than being out on a boat catching some fish.</p>
<h2 style="color:orange;">Other Interests</h2>
<p>I've been playing chess since I was in second grade. It is one of my favorite ways to pass time and I play almost every day</p>
